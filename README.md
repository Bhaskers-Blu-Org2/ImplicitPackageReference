Nuget requires packages to declare all their dependencies that are called from within the packages. If a User calls a dependencyâ€™s dependencies, they will need to declare that package as a direct dependency and will need to find and put the correct version of the package. This can cause a problem if the wrong version of the package is referenced, or if the version of the package is updated. This would cause the user to have the incorrect version of the dependency. ImplicitPackageReference was created to solve finding and packing the version of packages that are used in a project but are just dependencies of their dependencies. 

All one must do to use ImplicitPackageReference is import the Nuget Package. Then add the packages you wish to discover the versions for in the following format.

<ImplicitPackageReference Include="Microsoft.AspNetCore.Http.Abstractions" />

ImplicitPacageReference will make sure that package is packed into your Nuget package you are creating. This will only work if the package you are looking for is a dependency of one of your dependency. If the package is not found, the build will fail.
